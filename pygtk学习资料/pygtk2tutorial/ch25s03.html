      You do not have to store all of your callback methods in one main
      program file.  You can separate them into classes of their own, in
      separate files. This way your main program can derive the methods from
      those classes using inheritance. You end up having all the original
      functionality with the added benifits of easier maintenance, code
      reusability, and smaller file sizes, which means less of a burden for
      text editors.
    </p></div><div class="sect2" title="25.3.2. Inheritance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp6619048"></a>25.3.2. Inheritance</h3></div></div></div><p>
      Inheritance is a way to reuse code. A class can inherit all the
      functionality of other classes, and the nice thing about inheritance
      is that we can use it to divide a huge program into logical groups of
      smaller, more maintainable pieces.
    </p><p>
      Now lets spend a second on terminology. A derived class, some call
      this a subclass or a child class, is a class that derives some of its
      functionality from other classes.

      A base class, some call it a superclass or a parent class, is what the
      derived class inherits from.
    </p><p>
      Below is a short example to help you become familiar with
      inheritance. You can try this out in the python interpreter to gain
      some first hand experience.
    </p><p>
      Create two base classes:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
class base1:
   base1_attribute = 1
   def base1_method(self):
     return "hello from base class 1"

class base2:
   base2_attribute = 2
   def base2_method(self):
     return "hello from base class 2"
    </pre><p>
      Then create a derived class that inherits from these two base classes:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
class derived(base1, base2):  #a class derived from two base classes
   var3 = 3                     
    </pre><p>
      Now the derived class has all the functionality of the base classes. 
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
x = derived()        # creates an instance of the derived class
x.base1_attribute    # 1
x.base2_attribute    # 2
x.var3               # 3
x.base1_method()     # hello from base class 1
x.base2_method()     # hello from base class 2
    </pre><p>
      The object called x has the ability to access the variables and
      methods of the base classes because it has inherited their
      functionality.  Now lets apply this concept of inheritance to a PyGTK
      application.

      If your run this program you will find it is just a simple window with
      some buttons. As the program is organized right now, all of the code
      is in one single file.  But in a moment, you will find out how to
      break that program up into multiple files.  The idea is to take those
      four callback methods out of the gui class and put them into classes
      of their own, in separate files. Now if you had hundreds of callback
      methods you would try and group them in some logical way, for example,
      you might put all of your methods that deal with input/output into the
      same class, and you would make other classes for other groups of
      methods as well.
    </p><p>
      The first thing we have to do is make some classes for the methods in
      the gui.py file. Create three new text files, and name them io.py,
      undo.py, and destroy.py, and put these files in the same directory as
      the gui.py file.  Copy the code below into the io.py file.
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
class io:                                                       
  def open(self, widget):                                  
    print "opens stuff"                                          
                                      
  def save(self, widget):                                  
    print "save stuff"                                           
    </pre><p>
      These are the two callback methods, open and save, from the gui.py
      program.  Copy the next block of code into the undo.py file.
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
class undo:                                                      
  def undo(self, widget):                                  
    print "undo stuff" 
    </pre><p> 
      This is the undo_method from gui.py.  And finally, copy the code below
      into destroy.py.
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
import gtk

class destroy:
  def destroy(self, widget):
    gtk.main_quit()                                                            
    </pre><p>
      Now all the methods are separated into classes of their own.

        In your future programs you will want to import things like gtk,
        pango, os ect...  into your derived class(the one with all of your
        gui initialization code), but also, remember to import any modules
        or classes you need into your base classes too. Sometimes you might
        create an instance of a gtk widget in a base class method, in that
        case import gtk.
      </p><p>
        This is just an example of a base class where you would be required
        to import gtk.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
  import gtk                                                        
                                                                           
  class Font_io                                                     
    def Font_Chooser(self,widget):                                  
      self.fontchooser = gtk.FontSelectionDialog("Choose Font")                                  
      self.fontchooser.show()    
      </pre><p>
        Notice it defines a gtk widget, a font selection dialog. You would
        normally import gtk in your main class(the derived class) and
        everything would be ok. But the second you take this Font_Chooser
        method out of your main class and put it into a class of its own,
        and then try to inherit from it, you would find you get an error.
        In this case, you would not even see any error until you were
        running the program.  But when you try to use the Font_Chooser, you
        would find that gtk is not defined, even though you have imported it
        in your derived class. So just remember that when you create base
        classes, you need to add their proper imports too.
      </p></div><p>
      With your three classes in three separate py files, you now need to
      change the code in the gui.py file in three ways.
    </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Import the classes you have created.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Change your class definition.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Delete your callback methods.</p></li></ol></div><p>

 gui_instance.main()        # call the main method
    </pre><p>
      These three lines are new:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
       from io import io                                   
       from undo import undo                                          
       from destroy import destroy     
    </pre><p>
      The import statements are of the form:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
       from [filename of your class file] import [class name]
    </pre><p>
      Here is the class definition change:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
       class gui(io, undo, destroy):
    </pre><p>
      The names of the base classes go between the parenthesis in the class
      definition.  Now the gui class has become a derived class, and is able
      to use all the attributes and methods defined in its base
      classes. Also, the gui class is inheriting from multiple classes(two
      or more), this is known as multiple inheritance.
    </p><p>
      Now change the gui.py file to the updated version and run the program
      again.  You will notice it works exactly the same, except now all the
      callback methods are in separate classes, being inherited by the gui
      class.
    </p><p>
      There is just one other matter of interest to take note of.  As long
      as your gui.py program and your base class files are all in the same
      directory, everything will work just fine. But if you want to create
      another directory inside there called classes, in which to organize
      your files of base classes, then you will need to add two more lines
      of code with the rest of your import statements in gui.py, like this:
    </p><pre class="programlisting">
        import sys
        sys.path.append("classes")
    </pre><p>
      where classes is the name of the directory you store your classes
      in. This lets Python know where to look for your classes.  Try it
      out. Just make a directory called classes in the directory where you
      have the gui.py program. Then put your three base class files into
      this classes directory.  Now add the two lines of code show above to
      the top of the gui.py file.  And thats it!
    </p><p>
      One final note for those that use py2exe for compiling python
      programs. Put your base classes in your Python directory, then py2exe
      will included them in the compiled version of your program just like
      any other Python module.
