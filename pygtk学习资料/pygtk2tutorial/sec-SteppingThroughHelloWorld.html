walking through the example <a class="ulink" href="examples/helloworld.py" target="_top"><span class="command"><strong>helloworld.py</strong></span></a>
program.</p><p>Lines 9-76 define the <code class="classname">HelloWorld</code> class
that contains all the callbacks as object methods and the object instance
initialization method. Let's examine the callback methods.</p><p>Lines 13-14 define the <code class="methodname">hello</code>() callback
method that will be called when the button is "clicked". When called the
method, prints "Hello World" to the console. We ignore the object instance,
the widget and the data parameters in this example, but most callbacks use
them. The <em class="parameter"><code>data</code></em> is defined with a default value of
<code class="varname">None</code> because PyGTK will not pass a data value if it is
not included in the <code class="methodname">connect</code>() call; this would
trigger an error since the callback is expecting three parameters and may
receive only two. Defining a default value of None allows the callback to be
called with two or three parameters without error. In this case the data
parameter could have been left out since the
<code class="methodname">hello</code>() method will always be called with just two
parameters (never called with user data). The next example will use the
<em class="parameter"><code>data argument</code></em> to tell us which button was
pressed.</p><pre class="programlisting">
  def hello(self, widget, data=None):
      print "Hello World"
</pre><p>The next callback (lines 16-26) is a bit special. The
"delete_event" occurs when the window manager sends this event to the
application. We have a choice here as to what to do about these events. We
can ignore them, make some sort of response, or simply quit the
application.</p><p>The value you return in this callback lets GTK+ know what action
to take. By returning TRUE, we let it know that we don't want to have the
"destroy" signal emitted, keeping our application running. By returning
FALSE, we ask that "destroy" be emitted, which in turn will call our
"destroy" signal handler. Note the comments have been removed for
clarity.</p><pre class="programlisting">
  def delete_event(widget, event, data=None):
      print "delete event occurred"
      return False
</pre><p>The <code class="methodname">destroy</code>() callback method (lines
28-30) causes the program to quit by calling
<code class="function">gtk.main_quit</code>() .  This function tells GTK+ that it is
to exit from <code class="function">gtk.main</code>() when control is returned to
it.</p><pre class="programlisting">

instance initialization method <code class="methodname">__init__</code>() that creates
the window and widgets used by the program.</p><p>Line 34 creates a new window, but it is not displayed until we
direct GTK+ to show the window near the end of our program. The window
reference is saved in an object instance attribute (self.window) for later

    self.window = gtk.Window(gtk.WINDOW_TOPLEVEL)
</pre><p>Lines 41 and 46 illustrate two examples of connecting a signal
handler to an object, in this case, the <code class="varname">window</code>. Here, the
"delete_event" and "destroy" signals are caught. The first is emitted when
we use the window manager to kill the window, or when we use the
<code class="classname">GtkWidget</code> <code class="methodname">destroy</code>() method
call.  The second is emitted when, in the "delete_event" handler, we return
<code class="varname">FALSE</code>.</p><pre class="programlisting">
    self.window.connect("delete_event", self.delete_event)

</pre><p>Line 49 sets an attribute of a container object (in this case
the <code class="varname">window</code>) to have a blank area along the inside of it
10 pixels wide where no widgets will be placed. There are other similar
methods that we will look at in <a class="xref" href="ch-SettingWidgetAttributes.html" title="Chapter 18. Setting Widget Attributes">Chapter 18, <i>Setting Widget Attributes</i></a></p><pre class="programlisting">

<code class="varname">self.button</code>. The button will have the label "Hello World"
when displayed.</p><pre class="programlisting">
    self.button = gtk.Button("Hello World")
</pre><p>In line 57 we attach a signal handler to the button so when it
emits the "clicked" signal, our <code class="methodname">hello</code>() callback
method is called. We are not passing any data to
<code class="methodname">hello</code>() so we just pass <code class="varname">None</code> as
the data. Obviously, the "clicked" signal is emitted when we click the
button with our mouse pointer. The user data parameter value
<code class="varname">None</code> is not required and could be removed. The callback
would then be called with one less parameter.</p><pre class="programlisting">
    self.button.connect("clicked", self.hello, None)
</pre><p>We are also going to use this button to exit our program. Line
62 illustrates how the "destroy" signal may come from either the window
manager, or from our program. When the button is "clicked", same as above,
it calls the <code class="methodname">hello</code>() callback first, and then the
following one in the order they are set up. You may have as many callbacks
as you need, and all will be executed in the order you connected
them.</p><p>Since we want to use the <code class="classname">GtkWidget</code>
<code class="methodname">destroy</code>() method that accepts one argument (the
widget to be destroyed - in this case the <code class="varname">window</code>), we use
the <code class="methodname">connect_object</code>() method and pass it the
reference to the window. The <code class="methodname">connect_object</code>()
method arranges to pass the <em class="parameter"><code>window</code></em> as the first
callback argument instead of the button.</p><p>When the <code class="classname">gtk.Widget</code>
<code class="methodname">destroy</code>() method is called it will cause the
"destroy" signal to be emitted from the window which will in turn cause the
<code class="classname">HelloWorld</code> <code class="methodname">destroy</code>() method
to be called to end the program.</p><pre class="programlisting">
    self.button.connect_object("clicked", gtk.Widget.destroy, self.window)
</pre><p>Line 65 is a packing call, which will be explained in depth
later on in <a class="xref" href="ch-PackingWidgets.html" title="Chapter 4. Packing Widgets">Chapter 4, <i>Packing Widgets</i></a> . But it is fairly
easy to understand. It simply tells GTK+ that the button is to be placed in
the window where it will be displayed. Note that a GTK+ container can only
contain one widget. There are other widgets, described later, that are
designed to layout multiple widgets in various ways.</p><pre class="programlisting">
    self.window.add(self.button)
</pre><p>Now we have everything set up the way we want it to be. With all
the signal handlers in place, and the button placed in the window where it
should be, we ask GTK+ (lines 66 and 69) to "show" the widgets on the screen.
The window widget is shown last so the whole window will pop up at once
rather than seeing the window pop up, and then the button forming inside of
it. Although with such a simple example, you'd never notice.</p><pre class="programlisting">
    self.button.show()

    self.window.show()
</pre><p>Widgets also have a <code class="methodname">hide()</code> that is the
opposite of <code class="methodname">show()</code>.  It doesn't actually
destroy the widget, but it removes the widget renderining from your
display.  This can be reversed with another
<code class="methodname">show()</code> call.</p><p>Lines 73-75 define the <code class="methodname">main</code>() method
which calls the <code class="function">gtk.main</code>() function</p><pre class="programlisting">
    def main(self):
        gtk.main()
</pre><p>Lines 80-82 allow the program to run automatically if called
directly or as an argument of the python interpreter. Line 81 creates an
instance of the <code class="classname">HelloWorld</code> class and saves a
reference to it in the <code class="varname">hello</code> variable. Line 82 calls the
<code class="classname">HelloWorld</code> class <code class="methodname">main</code>()
method to start the GTK+ event processing loop.</p><pre class="programlisting">
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        hello = HelloWorld()
        hello.main()
</pre><p>Now, when we click the mouse button on a GTK+ button, the widget
emits a "clicked" signal. In order for us to use this information, our
program sets up a signal handler to catch that signal, which dispatches the
function of our choice. In our example, when the button we created is
"clicked", the <code class="methodname">hello</code>() method is called with the
<code class="literal">None</code> argument, and then the next handler for this signal
is called. The next handler calls the widget
<code class="methodname">destroy</code>() function with the window as its argument
thereby causing the window to emit the "destroy" signal, which is caught,
and calls our <code class="classname">HelloWorld</code>
<code class="methodname">destroy</code>() method</p><p>Another course of events is to use the window manager to kill
the window, which will cause the "delete_event" to be emitted. This will
call our "delete_event" handler. If we return <code class="varname">TRUE</code> here,
the window will be left as is and nothing will happen. Returning
<code class="varname">FALSE</code> will cause GTK+ to emit the "destroy" signal that
causes the <code class="classname">HelloWorld</code> "destroy" callback to be
called, exiting GTK.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="sec-Events.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch-GettingStarted.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch-MovingOn.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">2.3. Events </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 3. Moving On</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
