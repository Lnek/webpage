<p>mk-table-sync - Synchronize MySQL table data efficiently.</p>

<hr />
</div><h1><a name="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<p>Usage: mk-table-sync [OPTION...] DSN [DSN...]</p>
<p>mk-table-sync synchronizes data efficiently between MySQL tables.</p>
<p>This tool changes data, so for maximum safety, you should back up your data
before you use it.  When synchronizing a server that is a replication slave with
the --replicate or --sync-to-master methods, it <strong>always</strong> makes the changes on
the replication master, <strong>never</strong> the replication slave directly.  This is in
general the only safe way to bring a replica back in sync with its master;
changes to the replica are usually the source of the problems in the first
place.  However, the changes it makes on the master should be no-op changes that
set the data to their current values, and actually affect only the replica.
Please read the detailed documentation that follows to learn more about this.</p>
<p>Sync db.tbl on host1 to host2:</p>
<pre>
  mk-table-sync --execute h=host1,D=db,t=tbl h=host2</pre>
<p>Sync all tables on host1 to host2 and host3:</p>
<pre>
  mk-table-sync --execute host1 host2 host3</pre>
<p>Make slave1 have the same data as its replication master:</p>
<pre>
  mk-table-sync --execute --sync-to-master slave1</pre>
<p>Resolve differences that <em>mk-table-checksum</em> found on all slaves of master1:</p>
<pre>
  mk-table-sync --execute --replicate test.checksum master1</pre>
<p>Same as above but only resolve differences on slave1:</p>
<pre>
  mk-table-sync --execute --replicate test.checksum \
    --sync-to-master slave1</pre>
<p>Sync master2 in a master-master replication configuration, where master2's copy
of db.tbl is known or suspected to be incorrect:</p>
<pre>
  mk-table-sync --execute --sync-to-master h=master2,D=db,t=tbl</pre>
<p>Note that in the master-master configuration, the following will NOT do what you
want, because it will make changes directly on master2, which will then flow
through replication and change master1's data:</p>
<pre>
  # Don't do this in a master-master setup!
  mk-table-sync --execute h=master1,D=db,t=tbl master2</pre>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
</div><h1><a name="risks">RISKS</a></h1>
<p>The following section is included to inform users about the potential risks,
whether known or unknown, of using this tool.  The two main categories of risks
are those created by the nature of the tool (e.g. read-only tools vs. read-write
tools) and those created by bugs.</p>
<p>With great power comes great responsibility!  This tool changes data, so it is a
good idea to back up your data.  It is also very powerful, which means it is
very complex, so you should run it with the <a href="#dry_run">--dry-run</a> option to see what it
will do, until you're familiar with its operation.  If you want to see which
rows are different, without changing any data, use <a href="#print">--print</a> instead of
<a href="#execute">--execute</a>.</p>
<p>Be careful when using mk-table-sync in any master-master setup.  Master-master
replication is inherently tricky, and it's easy to make mistakes.  You need to
be sure you're using the tool correctly for master-master replication.  See the
<a href="#synopsis">SYNOPSIS</a> for the overview of the correct usage.</p>
<p>Also be careful with tables that have foreign key constraints with <code>ON DELETE</code>
or <code>ON UPDATE</code> definitions because these might cause unintended changes on the
child tables.</p>
<p>In general, this tool is best suited when your tables have a primary key or
unique index.  Although it can synchronize data in tables lacking a primary key
or unique index, it might be best to synchronize that data by another means.</p>
<p>At the time of this release, there is a potential bug using
<a href="#lock_and_rename">--lock-and-rename</a> with MySQL 5.1, a bug detecting certain differences,
a bug using <code>ROUND()</code> across different platforms, and a bug mixing collations.</p>
<p>The authoritative source for updated information is always the online issue
tracking system.  Issues that affect this tool will be marked as such.  You can
see a list of such issues at the following URL:

</div><h1><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p>mk-table-sync does one-way and bidirectional synchronization of table data.
It does <strong>not</strong> synchronize table structures, indexes, or any other schema
objects.  The following describes one-way synchronization.
<a href="#bidirectional_syncing">BIDIRECTIONAL SYNCING</a> is described later.</p>
<p>This tool is complex and functions in several different ways.  To use it
safely and effectively, you should understand three things: the purpose
of <a href="#replicate">--replicate</a>, finding differences, and specifying hosts.  These
three concepts are closely related and determine how the tool will run. 
The following is the abbreviated logic:</p>
<pre>
   if DSN has a t part, sync only that table:
      if 1 DSN:
         if --sync-to-master:
            The DSN is a slave.  Connect to its master and sync.
      if more than 1 DSN:
         The first DSN is the source.  Sync each DSN in turn.
   else if --replicate:
      if --sync-to-master:
         The DSN is a slave.  Connect to its master, find records
         of differences, and fix.
      else:
         The DSN is the master.  Find slaves and connect to each,
         find records of differences, and fix.
   else:
      if only 1 DSN and --sync-to-master:
         The DSN is a slave.  Connect to its master, find tables and
         filter with --databases etc, and sync each table to the master.
      else:
         find tables, filtering with --databases etc, and sync each
         DSN to the first.</pre>
<p>mk-table-sync can run in one of two ways: with <a href="#replicate">--replicate</a> or without.
The default is to run without <a href="#replicate">--replicate</a> which causes mk-table-sync
to automatically find differences efficiently with one of several
algorithms (see <a href="#algorithms">ALGORITHMS</a>).  Alternatively, the value of
<a href="#replicate">--replicate</a>, if specified, causes mk-table-sync to use the differences
already found by having previously ran <em>mk-table-checksum</em> with its own
<a href="#replicate"><code>--replicate</code></a> option.  Strictly speaking, you don't need to use
<a href="#replicate">--replicate</a> because mk-table-sync can find differences, but many
people use <a href="#replicate">--replicate</a> if, for example, they checksum regularly
using <em>mk-table-checksum</em> then fix differences as needed with mk-table-sync.
If you're unsure, read each tool's documentation carefully and decide for
yourself, or consult with an expert.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether <a href="#replicate">--replicate</a> is used or not, you need to specify
which hosts to sync.  There are two ways: with <a href="#sync_to_master">--sync-to-master</a> or
without.  Specifying <a href="#sync_to_master">--sync-to-master</a> makes mk-table-sync expect
one and only slave DSN on the command line.  The tool will automatically
discover the slave's master and sync it so that its data is the same as
its master.  This is accomplished by making changes on the master which
then flow through replication and update the slave to resolve its differences.
<strong>Be careful though</strong>: although this option specifies and syncs a single
slave, if there are other slaves on the same master, they will receive
via replication the changes intended for the slave that you're trying to
sync.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you do not specify <a href="#sync_to_master">--sync-to-master</a>, the first
DSN given on the command line is the source host.  There is only ever
one source host.  If you do not also specify <a href="#replicate">--replicate</a>, then you
must specify at least one other DSN as the destination host.  There
can be one or more destination hosts.  Source and destination hosts
must be independent; they cannot be in the same replication topology.
mk-table-sync will die with an error if it detects that a destination
host is a slave because changes are written directly to destination hosts
(and it's not safe to write directly to slaves).  Or, if you specify
<a href="#replicate">--replicate</a> (but not <a href="#sync_to_master">--sync-to-master</a>) then mk-table-sync expects
one and only one master DSN on the command line.  The tool will automatically
discover all the master's slaves and sync them to the master.  This is
the only way to sync several (all) slaves at once (because
<a href="#sync_to_master">--sync-to-master</a> only specifies one slave).</p>
<p>Each host on the command line is specified as a DSN.  The first DSN
(or only DSN for cases like <a href="#sync_to_master">--sync-to-master</a>) provides default values
for other DSNs, whether those other DSNs are specified on the command line
or auto-discovered by the tool.  So in this example,</p>
<pre>
  mk-table-sync --execute h=host1,u=msandbox,p=msandbox h=host2</pre>
<p>the host2 DSN inherits the <a href="#u"><code>u</code></a> and <a href="#p"><code>p</code></a> DSN parts from the host1 DSN.
Use the <a href="#explain_hosts">--explain-hosts</a> option to see how mk-table-sync will interpret
the DSNs given on the command line.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
</div><h1><a name="output">OUTPUT</a></h1>
<p>If you specify the <a href="#verbose">--verbose</a> option, you'll see information about the 
differences between the tables.  There is one row per table.  Each server is
printed separately.  For example,</p>
<pre>
  # Syncing h=host1,D=test,t=test1
  # DELETE REPLACE INSERT UPDATE ALGORITHM START    END      EXIT DATABASE.TABLE
  #      0       0      3      0 Chunk     13:00:00 13:00:17 2    test.test1</pre>
<p>Table test.test1 on host1 required 3 <code>INSERT</code> statements to synchronize
and it used the Chunk algorithm (see <a href="#algorithms">ALGORITHMS</a>).  The sync operation
for this table started at 13:00:00 and ended 17 seconds later (times taken
from <code>NOW()</code> on the source host).  Because differences were found, its
<a href="#exit_status">EXIT STATUS</a> was 2.</p>
<p>If you specify the <a href="#print">--print</a> option, you'll see the actual SQL statements
that the script uses to synchronize the table if <a href="#execute">--execute</a> is also
specified.</p>
<p>If you want to see the SQL statements that mk-table-sync is using to select
chunks, nibbles, rows, etc., then specify <a href="#print">--print</a> once and <a href="#verbose">--verbose</a>
twice.  Be careful though: this can print a lot of SQL statements.</p>
<p>There are cases where no combination of <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code> or <code>DELETE</code>
statements can resolve differences without violating some unique key.  For
example, suppose there's a primary key on column a and a unique key on column b.
Then there is no way to sync these two tables with straightforward UPDATE
statements:</p>
<pre>
 +---+---+  +---+---+
 | a | b |  | a | b |
 +---+---+  +---+---+
 | 1 | 2 |  | 1 | 1 |
 | 2 | 1 |  | 2 | 2 |
 +---+---+  +---+---+</pre>
<p>The tool rewrites queries to <code>DELETE</code> and <code>REPLACE</code> in this case.  This is
automatically handled after the first index violation, so you don't have to
worry about it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
</div><h1><a name="replication_safety">REPLICATION SAFETY</a></h1>
<p>Synchronizing a replication master and slave safely is a non-trivial problem, in
general.  There are all sorts of issues to think about, such as other processes
changing data, trying to change data on the slave, whether the destination and
source are a master-master pair, and much more.</p>
<p>In general, the safe way to do it is to change the data on the master, and let
the changes flow through replication to the slave like any other changes.
However, this works only if it's possible to REPLACE into the table on the
master.  REPLACE works only if there's a unique index on the table (otherwise it
just acts like an ordinary INSERT).</p>
<p>If your table has unique keys, you should use the <a href="#sync_to_master">--sync-to-master</a> and/or
<a href="#replicate">--replicate</a> options to sync a slave to its master.  This will generally do
the right thing.  When there is no unique key on the table, there is no choice
but to change the data on the slave, and mk-table-sync will detect that you're
trying to do so.  It will complain and die unless you specify
<a href="#no_check_slave"><code>--no-check-slave</code></a> (see <a href="#no_check_slave">--[no]check-slave</a>).</p>
<p>If you're syncing a table without a primary or unique key on a master-master
pair, you must change the data on the destination server.  Therefore, you need
to specify <a href="#no_bin_log"><code>--no-bin-log</code></a> for safety (see <a href="#no_bin_log">--[no]bin-log</a>).  If you don't,
the changes you make on the destination server will replicate back to the
source server and change the data there!</p>
<p>The generally safe thing to do on a master-master pair is to use the
<a href="#sync_to_master">--sync-to-master</a> option so you don't change the data on the destination
server.  You will also need to specify <a href="#no_check_slave"><code>--no-check-slave</code></a> to keep
mk-table-sync from complaining that it is changing data on a slave.</p>
<p>
</p>
<hr />
</div><h1><a name="algorithms">ALGORITHMS</a></h1>
<p>mk-table-sync has a generic data-syncing framework which uses different
algorithms to find differences.  The tool automatically chooses the best
algorithm for each table based on indexes, column types, and the algorithm
preferences specified by <a href="#algorithms">--algorithms</a>.  The following algorithms are
available, listed in their default order of preference:</p>
<dl>
<dt><strong><a name="chunk" class="item">Chunk</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Finds an index whose first column is numeric (including date and time types),
and divides the column's range of values into chunks of approximately
<a href="#chunk_size">--chunk-size</a> rows.  Syncs a chunk at a time by checksumming the entire
chunk.  If the chunk differs on the source and destination, checksums each
chunk's rows individually to find the rows that differ.</p>
<p>It is efficient when the column has sufficient cardinality to make the chunks
end up about the right size.</p>
<p>The initial per-chunk checksum is quite small and results in minimal network
traffic and memory consumption.  If a chunk's rows must be examined, only the
primary key columns and a checksum are sent over the network, not the entire
row.  If a row is found to be different, the entire row will be fetched, but not
before.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="nibble" class="item">Nibble</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Finds an index and ascends the index in fixed-size nibbles of <a href="#chunk_size">--chunk-size</a>
rows, using a non-backtracking algorithm (see <em>mk-archiver</em> for more on this
algorithm).  It is very similar to <a href="#chunk">Chunk</a>, but instead of pre-calculating
the boundaries of each piece of the table based on index cardinality, it uses
<code>LIMIT</code> to define each nibble's upper limit, and the previous nibble's upper
limit to define the lower limit.</p>
<p>It works in steps: one query finds the row that will define the next nibble's
upper boundary, and the next query checksums the entire nibble.  If the nibble
differs between the source and destination, it examines the nibble row-by-row,
just as <a href="#chunk">Chunk</a> does.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="groupby" class="item">GroupBy</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Selects the entire table grouped by all columns, with a COUNT(*) column added.
Compares all columns, and if they're the same, compares the COUNT(*) column's
value to determine how many rows to insert or delete into the destination.
Works on tables with no primary key or unique index.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="stream" class="item">Stream</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Selects the entire table in one big stream and compares all columns.  Selects
all columns.  Much less efficient than the other algorithms, but works when
there is no suitable index for them to use.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="future_plans" class="item">Future Plans</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Possibilities for future algorithms are TempTable (what I originally called
bottom-up in earlier versions of this tool), DrillDown (what I originally
called top-down), and GroupByPrefix (similar to how SqlYOG Job Agent works).
Each algorithm has strengths and weaknesses.  If you'd like to implement your
favorite technique for finding differences between two sources of data on
possibly different servers, I'm willing to help.  The algorithms adhere to a
simple interface that makes it pretty easy to write your own.</p>
</dd>

</p>
<hr />
</div><h1><a name="bidirectional_syncing">BIDIRECTIONAL SYNCING</a></h1>
<p>Bidirectional syncing is a new, experimental feature.  To make it work
reliably there are a number of strict limitations:</p>
<pre>
  * only works when syncing one server to other independent servers
  * does not work in any way with replication
  * requires that the table(s) are chunkable with the Chunk algorithm
  * is not N-way, only bidirectional between two servers at a time
  * does not handle DELETE changes</pre>
<p>For example, suppose we have three servers: c1, r1, r2.  c1 is the central
server, a pseudo-master to the other servers (viz. r1 and r2 are not slaves
to c1).  r1 and r2 are remote servers.  Rows in table foo are updated and
inserted on all three servers and we want to synchronize all the changes
between all the servers.  Table foo has columns:</p>
<pre>
  id    int PRIMARY KEY
  ts    timestamp auto updated
  name  varchar</pre>
<p>Auto-increment offsets are used so that new rows from any server do not
create conflicting primary key (id) values.  In general, newer rows, as
determined by the ts column, take precedence when a same but differing row
is found during the bidirectional sync.  &quot;Same but differing&quot; means that
two rows have the same primary key (id) value but different values for some
other column, like the name column in this example.  Same but differing
conflicts are resolved by a &quot;conflict&quot;.  A conflict compares some column of
the competing rows to determine a &quot;winner&quot;.  The winning row becomes the
source and its values are used to update the other row.</p>
<p>There are subtle differences between three columns used to achieve
bidirectional syncing that you should be familiar with: chunk column
(<a href="#chunk_column">--chunk-column</a>), comparison column(s) (<a href="#columns">--columns</a>), and conflict
column (<a href="#conflict_column">--conflict-column</a>).  The chunk column is only used to chunk the
table; e.g. &quot;WHERE id &gt;= 5 AND id &lt; 10&quot;.  Chunks are checksummed and when
chunk checksums reveal a difference, the tool selects the rows in that
chunk and checksums the <a href="#columns">--columns</a> for each row.  If a column checksum
differs, the rows have one or more conflicting column values.  In a
traditional unidirectional sync, the conflict is a moot point because it can
be resolved simply by updating the entire destination row with the source
row's values.  In a bidirectional sync, however, the <a href="#conflict_column">--conflict-column</a>
(in accordance with other <code>--conflict-*</code> options list below) is compared
to determine which row is &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;authoritative&quot;; this row becomes
the &quot;source&quot;.</p>
<p>To sync all three servers completely, two runs of mk-table-sync are required.
The first run syncs c1 and r1, then syncs c1 and r2 including any changes
from r1.  At this point c1 and r2 are completely in sync, but r1 is missing
any changes from r2 because c1 didn't have these changes when it and r1
were synced.  So a second run is needed which syncs the servers in the same
order, but this time when c1 and r1 are synced r1 gets r2's changes.</p>
<p>The tool does not sync N-ways, only bidirectionally between the first DSN
given on the command line and each subsequent DSN in turn.  So the tool in
this example would be ran twice like:</p>
<pre>
  mk-table-sync --bidirectional h=c1 h=r1 h=r2</pre>
<p>The <a href="#bidirectional">--bidirectional</a> option enables this feature and causes various
sanity checks to be performed.  You must specify other options that tell
mk-table-sync how to resolve conflicts for same but differing rows.
These options are:</p>
<pre>
  * L&lt;--conflict-column&gt;
  * L&lt;--conflict-comparison&gt;
  * L&lt;--conflict-value&gt;
  * L&lt;--conflict-threshold&gt;
  * L&lt;--conflict-error&gt;  (optional)</pre>
<p>Use <a href="#print">--print</a> to test this option before <a href="#execute">--execute</a>.  The printed
SQL statements will have comments saying on which host the statement
would be executed if you used <a href="#execute">--execute</a>.</p>
<p>Technical side note: the first DSN is always the &quot;left&quot; server and the other
DSNs are always the &quot;right&quot; server.  Since either server can become the source
or destination it's confusing to think of them as &quot;src&quot; and &quot;dst&quot;.  Therefore,
they're generically referred to as left and right.  It's easy to remember
this because the first DSN is always to the left of the other server DSNs on
the command line.</p>

<p>This option adds the <code>SQL_BUFFER_RESULT</code> option to the comparison queries.
This causes MySQL to execute the queries and place them in a temporary table
internally before sending the results back to mk-table-sync.  The advantage of
this strategy is that mk-table-sync can fetch rows as desired without using a
lot of memory inside the Perl process, while releasing locks on the MySQL table
(to reduce contention with other queries).  The disadvantage is that it uses
more memory on the MySQL server instead.</p>
<p>You probably want to leave <a href="#no_buffer_to_client">--[no]buffer-to-client</a> enabled too, because
buffering into a temp table and then fetching it all into Perl's memory is
probably a silly thing to do.  This option is most useful for the GroupBy and
Stream algorithms, which may fetch a lot of data from the server.</p>

<p>Fetch rows one-by-one from MySQL while comparing.</p>
<p>This option enables <code>mysql_use_result</code> which causes MySQL to hold the selected
rows on the server until the tool fetches them.  This allows the tool to use
less memory but may keep the rows locked on the server longer.</p>
<p>If this option is disabled by specifying <a href="#no_buffer_to_client"><code>--no-buffer-to-client</code></a> then
<code>mysql_store_result</code> is used which causes MySQL to send all selected rows to
the tool at once.  This may result in the results &quot;cursor&quot; being held open for
a shorter time on the server, but if the tables are large, it could take a long
time anyway, and use all your memory.</p>
<p>For most non-trivial data sizes, you want to leave this option enabled.</p>

the values are converted to strings by the <code>CONCAT()</code> function, and MySQL chooses

<pre>
  VALUE  MEANING
  =====  =======================================================
  0      Never lock tables.
  1      Lock and unlock one time per sync cycle (as implemented
         by the syncing algorithm).  This is the most granular
         level of locking available.  For example, the Chunk
         algorithm will lock each chunk of C&lt;N&gt; rows, and then
         unlock them if they are the same on the source and the
         destination, before moving on to the next chunk.
  2      Lock and unlock before and after each table.
  3      Lock and unlock once for every server (DSN) synced, with
         C&lt;FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK&gt;.</pre>
<p>A replication slave is never locked if <a href="#replicate">--replicate</a> or <a href="#sync_to_master">--sync-to-master</a>
is specified, since in theory locking the table on the master should prevent any
changes from taking place.  (You are not changing data on your slave, right?)
If <a href="#wait">--wait</a> is given, the master (source) is locked and then the tool waits
for the slave to catch up to the master before continuing.</p>
<p>If <code>--transaction</code> is specified, <code>LOCK TABLES</code> is not used.  Instead, lock
and unlock are implemented by beginning and committing transactions.
The exception is if <a href="#lock">--lock</a> is 3.</p>
<p>If <a href="#no_transaction"><code>--no-transaction</code></a> is specified, then <code>LOCK TABLES</code> is used for any
value of <a href="#lock">--lock</a>. See <a href="#no_transaction">--[no]transaction</a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="lock_and_rename" class="item">--lock-and-rename</a></strong></dt>

<p>Lock the source and destination table, sync, then swap names.  This is useful as
a less-blocking ALTER TABLE, once the tables are reasonably in sync with each
other (which you may choose to accomplish via any number of means, including
dump and reload or even something like <em>mk-archiver</em>).  It requires exactly two
DSNs and assumes they are on the same server, so it does no waiting for
replication or the like.  Tables are locked with LOCK TABLES.</p>

if the file contains a PID and a process is running with that PID, then
the script dies; or, if there is no process running with that PID, then the
script overwrites the file with its own PID and starts; else, if the file

<p>The processlist method is preferred because SHOW SLAVE HOSTS is not reliable.
However, the hosts method is required if the server uses a non-standard
port (not 3306).  Usually mk-table-sync does the right thing and finds

<dd>
<p>type: string</p>
<p>Sync tables listed as different in this table.</p>
<p>Specifies that <code>mk-table-sync</code> should examine the specified table to find data
that differs.  The table is exactly the same as the argument of the same name to
<em>mk-table-checksum</em>.  That is, it contains records of which tables (and ranges
of values) differ between the master and slave.</p>
<p>For each table and range of values that shows differences between the master and
slave, <code>mk-table-checksum</code> will sync that table, with the appropriate <code>WHERE</code>
clause, to its master.</p>
<p>This automatically sets <a href="#wait">--wait</a> to 60 and causes changes to be made on the
master instead of the slave.</p>
<p>If <a href="#sync_to_master">--sync-to-master</a> is specified, the tool will assume the server you
specified is the slave, and connect to the master as usual to sync.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it will try to use <code>SHOW PROCESSLIST</code> to find slaves of the server
you specified.  If it is unable to find any slaves via <code>SHOW PROCESSLIST</code>, it
will inspect <code>SHOW SLAVE HOSTS</code> instead.  You must configure each slave's
<code>report-host</code>, <code>report-port</code> and other options for this to work right.  After
finding slaves, it will inspect the specified table on each slave to find data
that needs to be synced, and sync it.</p>
<p>The tool examines the master's copy of the table first, assuming that the master
is potentially a slave as well.  Any table that shows differences there will
<strong>NOT</strong> be synced on the slave(s).  For example, suppose your replication is set
up as A-&gt;B, B-&gt;C, B-&gt;D.  Suppose you use this argument and specify server B.
The tool will examine server B's copy of the table.  If it looks like server B's
data in table <code>test.tbl1</code> is different from server A's copy, the tool will not
sync that table on servers C and D.</p>

<p>If you don't specify <code>--transaction</code> explicitly <code>mk-table-sync</code> will decide on
a per-table basis whether to use transactions or table locks.  It currently
uses transactions on InnoDB tables, and table locks on all others.</p>
<p>If <a href="#no_transaction"><code>--no-transaction</code></a> is specified, then <code>mk-table-sync</code> will not use
transactions at all (not even for InnoDB tables) and locking is controlled
by <a href="#lock">--lock</a>.</p>
<p>When enabled, either explicitly or implicitly, the transaction isolation level
is set <code>REPEATABLE READ</code> and transactions are started <code>WITH CONSISTENT
SNAPSHOT</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="trim" class="item">--trim</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p><code>TRIM()</code> <code>VARCHAR</code> columns in <code>BIT_XOR</code> and <code>ACCUM</code> modes.  Helps when
comparing MySQL 4.1 to &gt;= 5.0.</p>
<p>This is useful when you don't care about the trailing space differences between
MySQL versions which vary in their handling of trailing spaces. MySQL 5.0 and 
later all retain trailing spaces in <code>VARCHAR</code>, while previous versions would 
remove them.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="no_unique_checks" class="item">--[no]unique-checks</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>default: yes</p>
<p>Enable unique key checks (<code>SET UNIQUE_CHECKS=1</code>).</p>
<p>Specifying <a href="#no_unique_checks"><code>--no-unique-checks</code></a> will <code>SET UNIQUE_CHECKS=0</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="user" class="item">--user</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>short form: -u; type: string</p>
<p>User for login if not current user.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="verbose" class="item">--verbose</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>short form: -v; cumulative: yes</p>

<p>See <a href="#output">OUTPUT</a> for more details about the output.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="version" class="item">--version</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>Show version and exit.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="wait" class="item">--wait</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>short form: -w; type: time</p>
<p>How long to wait for slaves to catch up to their master.</p>
<p>Make the master wait for the slave to catch up in replication before comparing
the tables.  The value is the number of seconds to wait before timing out (see
also <a href="#timeout_ok">--timeout-ok</a>).  Sets <a href="#lock">--lock</a> to 1 and <a href="#no_transaction">--[no]transaction</a> to 0
by default.  If you see an error such as the following,</p>
<pre>
  MASTER_POS_WAIT returned -1</pre>
<p>It means the timeout was exceeded and you need to increase it.</p>
<p>The default value of this option is influenced by other options.  To see what
value is in effect, run with <a href="#help">--help</a>.</p>
<p>To disable waiting entirely (except for locks), specify <a href="#wait">--wait</a> 0.  This
helps when the slave is lagging on tables that are not being synced.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="where" class="item">--where</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>type: string</p>
<p><code>WHERE</code> clause to restrict syncing to part of the table.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong><a name="no_zero_chunk" class="item">--[no]zero-chunk</a></strong></dt>

<dd>
<p>default: yes</p>
<p>Add a chunk for rows with zero or zero-equivalent values.  The only has an
effect when <a href="#chunk_size">--chunk-size</a> is specified.  The purpose of the zero chunk
is to capture a potentially large number of zero values that would imbalance
the size of the first chunk.  For example, if a lot of negative numbers were
inserted into an unsigned integer column causing them to be stored as zeros,
then these zero values are captured by the zero chunk instead of the first
chunk and all its non-zero values.</p>

</div><h1><a name="history_and_acknowledgments">HISTORY AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</a></h1>
<p>My work is based in part on Giuseppe Maxia's work on distributed databases,
<a href="http://www.sysadminmag.com/articles/2004/0408/">http://www.sysadminmag.com/articles/2004/0408/</a> and code derived from that
article.  There is more explanation, and a link to the code, at
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=381053">http://www.perlmonks.org/</a>.</p>
<p>Another programmer extended Maxia's work even further.  Fabien Coelho changed
and generalized Maxia's technique, introducing symmetry and avoiding some
problems that might have caused too-frequent checksum collisions.  This work
grew into pg_comparator, <a href="http://www.coelho.net/pg_comparator/">http://www.coelho.net/pg_comparator/</a>.  Coelho also
explained the technique further in a paper titled &quot;Remote Comparison of Database
Tables&quot; (<a href="http://cri.ensmp.fr/classement/doc/A-375.pdf">http://cri.ensmp.fr/classement/doc/A-375.pdf</a>).</p>
<p>This existing literature mostly addressed how to find the differences between
the tables, not how to resolve them once found.  I needed a tool that would not
only find them efficiently, but would then resolve them.  I first began thinking
about how to improve the technique further with my article
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/mysql-data-diff-algorithm">http://tinyurl.com/mysql-data-diff-algorithm</a>,
where I discussed a number of problems with the Maxia/Coelho &quot;bottom-up&quot;
algorithm.  After writing that article, I began to write this tool.  I wanted to
actually implement their algorithm with some improvements so I was sure I
understood it completely.  I discovered it is not what I thought it was, and is
considerably more complex than it appeared to me at first.  Fabien Coelho was
kind enough to address some questions over email.</p>
<p>The first versions of this tool implemented a version of the Coelho/Maxia
algorithm, which I called &quot;bottom-up&quot;, and my own, which I called &quot;top-down.&quot;
Those algorithms are considerably more complex than the current algorithms and
I have removed them from this tool, and may add them back later.  The
improvements to the bottom-up algorithm are my original work, as is the
top-down algorithm.  The techniques to actually resolve the differences are
also my own work.</p>
<p>Another tool that can synchronize tables is the SQLyog Job Agent from webyog.
